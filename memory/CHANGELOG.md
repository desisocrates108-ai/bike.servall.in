# CHANGELOG — Servall CRM

## 2026-04-22 — Iteration 16: Unified KYC + Exchange Document System
**Scope**: Complete redesign — separate identity/KYC (all leads) from exchange-specific docs (Exchange only), with strict stage-gate enforcement.

### Data model
- `lead.identity_docs = { aadhaar: [fid], aadhaar_back: [fid], other: [fid,…] }` — top-level, applies to **all leads**.
- `lead.exchange.documents = { rc_front, rc_back, rc_pdf, front_photo, back_photo }` — Exchange only.
- Legacy `lead.exchange.photos[]` still supported for old data.

### Backend
- Refactored `POST /api/leads/{lid}/exchange-photos` to route by bucket:
  - Identity buckets → `lead.identity_docs.*`
  - Exchange buckets → `lead.exchange.documents.*`
  - Legacy `photo` → `lead.exchange.photos`
- `DELETE /api/leads/{lid}/exchange-photos/{file_id}` — transparently scans all three stores.
- **Stage-gate validation** on `POST /leads/{lid}/stage`:
  - Any forward stage past Inquiry requires `aadhaar` + `aadhaar_back`.
  - `purchase_type=Exchange Vehicle` additionally requires `rc_front` + `rc_back` + `front_photo` + `back_photo`.
  - Stage→Lost and Stage→Inquiry always allowed.
  - Returns `400` with exact missing list.
- **Conditional cleanup** — `PUT /api/leads/{lid}` with `purchase_type=New Purchase` on a previously Exchange lead wipes `lead.exchange` to null but preserves `identity_docs`.

### Frontend
- **NEW** `components/DocSlot.jsx` — shared slot with Capture + Upload split buttons (extracted from ExchangeSection).
- **NEW** `components/IdentityDocsPanel.jsx` — KYC panel (Aadhaar F/B + Other). Rendered in a new `tab-kyc` tab on LeadDetail, visible to **all leads**.
- **ExchangeSection.jsx** — Aadhaar removed (moved to KYC). Now 2 cards only: `Vehicle Documents (RC Book)` (rc-front, rc-back, rc-pdf) + `Vehicle Photos` (front, back).
- **LeadForm.jsx** — Unified `Identity Documents & Vehicle Uploads` section (always visible) with conditional RC + Vehicle Photo sub-sections when Exchange. Mandatory counts: 2 for New / 6 for Exchange. Submit uploads identity for all leads + exchange only when applicable.
- **LeadDetail.jsx** — New `tab-kyc` tab added between `Booking` and `Exchange`.

### Test report
`/app/test_reports/iteration_16.json` — **100% PASS** (18/18 backend pytest + full frontend Playwright). No blocking bugs.

## 2026-04-22 — Iteration 15: Split Capture/Upload Buttons + Aadhaar Front/Back
**Scope**: Clearer mobile UX per upload slot.

### Backend
- `allowed_types` in `POST /api/leads/{lid}/exchange-photos` extended with `aadhaar_back` (separate bucket from `aadhaar`).

### Frontend
- **Two separate buttons** per slot (both `ExchangeSection.jsx` DocSlot and `LeadForm.jsx` StagedSlot):
  - 📷 `*-capture-btn` → hidden input `*-capture-input` with `accept="image/*"` + `capture="environment"` (mobile rear camera)
  - ⬆️ `*-upload-btn` → hidden input `*-upload-input` with `accept="image/*,application/pdf"` (or `image/*` for photo slots), NO capture attribute (gallery/file picker)
- **Aadhaar split** into `Aadhaar Front` (`aadhaar` bucket) + `Aadhaar Back` (`aadhaar_back` bucket) — both mandatory.
- **Mandatory count → 5**: Aadhaar Front + Aadhaar Back + RC Book + Front Photo + Back Photo (`Other Documents` still optional-multi).
- Slots now use `h-10` button heights for larger mobile tap targets.
- Re-capture/Re-upload labels when a single file is already present.

### Test report
`/app/test_reports/iteration_15.json` — **100% PASS** (11/11 backend + full frontend Playwright).

## 2026-04-22 — Iteration 14: Exchange Vehicle Complete Docs & Images System
**Scope**: Full document/image upload pipeline during lead creation + restructured Exchange tab.

### Backend
- Extended allowed `doc_type` values on `POST /api/leads/{lid}/exchange-photos` to include `"other"` — stores in `lead.exchange.documents.other[]` (multi).
- Backward-compatible: `photo` (default) still goes to `exchange.photos[]`.

### Frontend
- **LeadForm.jsx**: New `Vehicle Documents & Images` section below Expected Price (only when purchase_type = Exchange Vehicle) with 5 staged slots:
  - Documents: Aadhaar * (single), RC Book * (single), Other Documents (multi, optional)
  - Vehicle Photos: Front * (camera), Back * (camera)
  - Files held in `stagedFiles` state; after successful POST `/api/leads`, the form iterates uploads to `/api/leads/{id}/exchange-photos?doc_type=<bucket>` sequentially. Toast shows upload progress.
- **ExchangeSection.jsx (LeadDetail)**:
  - Card renamed from "Mandatory Documents (4)" to **"Vehicle Documents & Images"**.
  - Two sub-blocks: `Documents` (3-col: Aadhaar, RC Book, Other multi) + `Vehicle Photos` (2-col: Front, Back).
  - Front/Back slots use `capture="environment"` for direct rear-camera capture on mobile.
  - Progress line counts 4 mandatory + "+N other" suffix.
  - Legacy `photos[]` bucket still visible as "Legacy Photos" card only if non-empty (backward-compat for old leads).

### Test report
`/app/test_reports/iteration_14.json` — **100% PASS** (12/12 backend + full frontend Playwright). Only one micro-race UX note (non-blocking).

## 2026-04-22 — Iteration 13: Interactive Gujarati Calendar Popup
**Scope**: Turn the static calendar widget into a live, data-driven, click-through month view.

### Backend
1. New endpoint `GET /api/analytics/calendar?year=&month=&branch_id=` — returns `{year, month, days: {YYYY-MM-DD: {deliveries[], followups[], upcoming[], overdue[]}}}`.
2. Fully RBAC-scoped: sales_executive → own leads, admin → own branch, super_admin → global (optional branch_id filter). Validates year ∈ [2024, 2035] and month ∈ [1, 12].
3. Data sources: `deliveries.delivery_date`, `bookings.expected_delivery_date`, `followups.scheduled_date`, `leads.next_followup_date` (overdue vs upcoming by `< today`).

### Frontend
- **New** `components/CalendarDialog.jsx` — overlay modal (Radix Dialog) with:
  - Month grid with prev/next/today controls
  - Color-coded event dots per date: 🟢 Delivered, 🔵 Follow-up, 🟡 Upcoming, 🔴 Overdue, 🟣 Festival (star for important ones)
  - Click any event-day → Day Detail view (same dialog) with Back button (`←`). Detail shows Festivals, Deliveries, Overdue, Upcoming, Follow-ups as sections; each lead row links to `/leads/{id}` and closes the dialog.
  - Escape / Close / Back / Today all wired.
  - Mobile-friendly (95vw, scrollable, ~92vh max height).
  - A11y: `DialogTitle`+`DialogDescription` in `sr-only`.
- `GujaratiCalendar.jsx` — the calendar-header icon replaced with clickable `calendar-open-btn` that opens the dialog. Accepts `branchId` prop; Dashboard forwards `branchFilter` when super_admin filters a branch.

### Test report
`/app/test_reports/iteration_13.json` — **100% PASS** (15/15 backend + full frontend desktop+mobile Playwright). Only a11y console warnings were flagged and fixed post-test.

## 2026-04-22 — Iteration 12: Wiring + Forms + Exchange Multi-Upload (P0 Bundle)
**Scope**: Complete the in-progress Iteration 12. All P0 items shipped + tested (18/18 backend + full frontend Playwright PASS).

### Backend
1. Extended `POST /api/leads/{lid}/exchange-photos` to accept `doc_type` query param ∈ {photo, aadhaar, rc_book, front_photo, back_photo}. Typed uploads land in `lead.exchange.documents.<bucket>[]`; default `photo` stays in `exchange.photos[]` (backward-compat preserved).
2. Added `DELETE /api/leads/{lid}/exchange-photos/{file_id}` — removes from both `photos[]` and `documents.*` and sets file `is_deleted=true`.
3. Verified `POST /api/leads/{lid}/stage` — stage=Lost without `lost_reason` returns 400 (pre-existing).
4. Verified `POST /api/leads` as `sales_executive` ignores body `branch_id` and auto-assigns user's own branch + assigns lead to self (pre-existing).
5. `GET /api/analytics/summary` + `/analytics/performance` `from_date`/`to_date` filters confirmed working.

### Frontend
- **Routes wired**: `/reminders` (all roles) + `/integrations` (super_admin + admin).
- **Sidebar nav**: `nav-reminders` (all roles) + `nav-integrations` (admin section).
- **Dashboard wiring**:
  - `DateRangeFilter` (today/week/month/year/all/custom) in header — feeds `/analytics/summary` + `/analytics/performance`.
  - `GujaratiCalendar` widget for super_admin + admin with crawling ticker, upcoming festivals, upcoming deliveries, past 14-day stats.
  - **Loss-analysis breakdown** card: per-`lost_reason` counts + % bars + links → `/leads?stage=Lost` (replaces plain loss card).
- **LeadForm.jsx**: `sales_executive` sees read-only `branch-auto-label` (auto-assigned branch) instead of branch dropdown.
- **LeadDetail.jsx**: Change-Stage `Confirm` button disabled until `lost_reason` picked; picking `Other` additionally requires `lost_reason_text`.
- **ExchangeSection.jsx**: new 4-slot `DocSlot` grid (Aadhaar, RC Book, Vehicle Front, Vehicle Back) with progress indicator (X/4), per-slot upload+delete. Existing `Additional Photos` section retained for extras.
- i18n (en + gu) keys added: `nav.reminders`, `nav.integrations`.

### Test report
`/app/test_reports/iteration_12.json` — **100% PASS** (18/18 backend + full frontend Playwright). No regressions.

## 2026-04-21 — Iteration 11: CEO + Sales Manager Compliance Audit
**Scope**: Full requirements audit against user's CEO + Sales Manager specs. Identified 5 gaps and shipped fixes.

### Backend gaps FIXED
1. **Seeded all 5 branches**: added Amalsad + Vansda (previously only Bilimora, Chikhli, Gandevi)
2. **`call_recording_url` + `call_recording_filename`** fields on `FollowupIn` model + `add_followup` persistence
3. **`RegistrationInfo` model** (status / rto_office / number_allotted / number_allotted_date / plate_fitted / plate_fitted_date / notes) added to `LeadUpdate` — PUT `/api/leads/{id}` now accepts `{registration: {...}}`
4. **Default WhatsApp templates seeded** (idempotent): "Inquiry — send catalog", "Delivery — thank you", "Feedback — request"
5. **Default automation rules seeded** (idempotent): Auto-send catalog on inquiry (`inquiry_created`), Thank you on delivery (`delivery_completed`), Feedback reminder (`feedback_reminder`)

### Frontend gaps FIXED
- **New `/reports` page** (`pages/Reports.jsx`): client-side aggregation over `/api/leads` → Source conversion % table, Loss-reason donut, Funnel chart with drop-offs, Customer behaviour breakdown, Brand performance, Top 10 sold models, Sales exec ranking table (click → /users/:id), Branch comparison bars (CEO only, click → /branches/:id). Super-admin gets `reports-branch-filter` dropdown.
- **Reports sidebar link** `nav-reports` (visible to admin + super_admin)
- **Route** `/reports` gated `roles=["super_admin","admin"]`
- **Registration tab** on LeadDetail (`tab-registration`) with full RegistrationSection form: status dropdown, RTO office, number allotted, allotted date, plate fitted checkbox, plate date (gated), notes, save → persists via PUT
- GlobalSearch now uses distinct testids `global-search-input` (desktop) and `global-search-input-mobile` to avoid duplicate-DOM test collisions

### Testing
- Iteration 11 report: `/app/test_reports/iteration_11.json`
- Backend: **7/7 pytest PASS** (`/app/backend/tests/test_iter11_compliance.py`)
- Frontend Playwright (desktop + mobile) all flows pass
- Super/admin Reports renders correctly; sales_executive is blocked
- Registration PUT round-trip verified (saved → reloaded → values retained)

### Known (non-blocking)
- `/reports` aggregation is client-side — OK for current seed volume; plan server-side `/api/reports/summary` endpoint before 5k+ leads
- Empty-state copy missing when branch filter yields 0 leads (UX polish, not a bug)
- Carry-over LOW: admin cross-branch filter silent scope vs explicit 403
- Carry-over MEDIUM: POST /api/users without phone → 500 (phone index already `sparse=True`; can harden at API layer)
